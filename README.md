# Config

A new try to keep a clean and simple to maintain repository of my config files.

To "install" the vim files:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/gaderian/.dotfiles.git
cd .dotfiles
stow vim
```

## Not included
There is a bunch of scripts/programs which is not included in this repository
which will mean that some things will simply not work until the references has
been fixed or removed, espessially within the config for i3. Hopefully I will
come around to fixing this to ensure it works out of the box or has some kind of
script for installing dependencies.
